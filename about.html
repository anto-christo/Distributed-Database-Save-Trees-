    <h1 class="display-4">ABOUT OUR NGO-SAVETREES</h1>
    <p class="lead">SaveTrees is a professionally run group of ordinary people extraordinarily determined to protect the environment not just by themselves, but also by sensitising others towards the importance of environment conservation and goading them on to participate in tree-plantation campaigns. The group consists of passionate nature lovers, who juggle corporate jobs during the week with their love for trees over the weekends. Though it started off as a weekend pursuit in 2007 now it does more than 50 tree plantation drives in 4 months of monsoon. SaveTrees spearheads a variety of initiatives including research, education, sensitisation and advocacy around the importance of environmental preservation and tree plantation. The group thrives on its vast volunteer base that runs into thousands, from young children to busy professionals, housewives and retired citizens. Today, SaveTrees organizes tree plantations and drives various initiatives across several Indian cities. We pro-actively engage in identifying potential areas for plantation, keeping in mind the biodiversity and ecological milieu of the local area. We try ensuring that the local communities reap multifold benefits; besides restoring the green cover, the trees also provide them with fruits, flowers, leaves etc commonly used in the community life. <br><br><br>

Our mission is to sensitise and empower people to give back to nature and live in an environment conducive to their health and well-being. Save Trees inspires citizens to spare just a few hours on weekends and work towards making their cities, and their lives greener. For seven years, we have worked untiringly with individuals and corporate teams alike to help change the landscape in Bangalore. We take pride in having fostered a buzzing community of tree lovers who continue to inspire and induct so many more in their fold. And yet, we are just at the beginning of a revolution. Our long term plans entail taking tree plantation drives to more number of cities and inducting many more tree enthusiasts, particularly corporate teams, to be able to amplify both scale and impact of our efforts.
